        <strong><i>"Probably the biggest change introduced in Episode One is how Alyx fights at Gordon's side for the majority of the game. Plenty of shooters have tried this and failed, with NPCs who get lost or get in the way or are just plain annoying. Valve strikes just the right notes with Alyx; she doesn't nag Gordon, she can competently follow you around, and even provides useful support a lot of the time. There's a fun sequence in the later chapters where you're free to run ahead and fight alone, but it's far more fun to draw enemies into Alyx's line of sight so she can snipe them from afar. Aside from her use in combat, Alyx is also effectively used to put a human face on things and keep the story moving along, and Episode One is a better game for it."<a href="http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/half-life-2-aftermath/710990p2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> -Game Spy</a></i></strong>

        <strong><i>"We may never get to see the long-delayed Half-Life 3, but Half-Life: Alyx gave us a taste of what that game might have been. Set five years before the events of Half-Life 2, we got to follow the story of Alyx Vance as they attempt to steal an alien superweapon. This game has remained a PC exclusive since its 2020 release partly because it is a VR shooter and is tied heavily to the PC architecture. It may eventually see a release on console VR, but for now, it remains exclusive to PCs."<a href="https://www.gamepur.com/guides/the-ten-best-pc-exclusive-games-of-all-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> -Gamepur</a></i></strong>

        <strong><i>"One of the first things that struck me when I started playing Half-Life: Alyx was the dirt under Alyx Vance’s fingernails. It’s a simple thing, but it’s not often that you see that level of fine detail in a VR game. Usually, virtual hands are either low-detail ghostly apparitions or gloved. This grit also tells us something about this character, a scrappy survivor raised in the aftermath of the Seven-Hour War in which the alien Combine conquered Earth, and it quickly establishes that she isn’t as buttoned-down as that MIT-educated nerd Dr. Gordon Freeman. Subtle as it is, it sets the stage for the best VR shooter I’ve ever played by a mile – and one of the best in any perspective."<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-alyx-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> -IGN</a></i></strong>

        <strong><i>"The attention to detail is obvious not just in how the world looks but in the ways you can interact with it. Alyx's disembodied hands react wonderfully to each object in the world, and it's hard not to just stand there admiring the way my virtual fingers close in different ways depending on what I'm holding: curling around a bottle, gently clasping an iron railing, holding a discarded cigarette butt between my  thumb and forefinger, gripping an empty water jug by the handle, pulling up the antenna and then gently twisting the tuning knob on a radio. Even discovering I can pick up a marker to scrawl something on a dirty window pane, and then realizing I can use an eraser to wipe it off, is delightful. You could easily spend 15 minutes just messing around with the physical objects in the introduction, and that's exactly what I did."<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/half-life-alyx-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> -PC Gamer</a></i></strong>
