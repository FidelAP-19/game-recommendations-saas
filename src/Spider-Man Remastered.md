                <h2 class="card__text-m">Spider-Man Remastered</h2>
              <p class="card__text-m">There is a reason this game is the best-selling PlayStation 4 game of all time and the remastered edition just makes this a must play for anyone on PlayStation 5. The improvement to take advantage of the PlayStation 5 hardware alongside the new spidey suites and a brand new photo mode added to what was an already a fantastic game. The only con about this new version is the minor changes to Peters’ face but compared to what was added it more than makes up for it.</p>

        <strong><i>"A remastered version of one of the best selling PS4 games of all time, this game is truly something to behold, and it required Insomniac Games to rebuild New York City completely using the latest gaming hardware."<a href="https://gaminggorilla.com/best-ps5-exclusive-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></i></strong> -View full Gaming Gorilla review</a>
        <strong><i>"Insomniac Games invested a huge amount of effort here, rebuilding New York City to take full advantage of the PS5 hardware, without interfering with the critically acclaimed action of the PS4 original. Some vocal fans were frustrated by the changes to protagonist Peter Parker’s face – but with new visual effects like ray tracing, in addition to silky smooth 60 frames-per-second refresh rates, this is the definitive way to experience Sony’s superb superhero sandbox. It even includes all of the original’s inconsequential but enjoyable expansion packs!"<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/best-ps5-exclusive-games?page=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></i></strong> -View full Push Square review</a>

        <strong><i>"Fortunately, Insomniac has retrofitted Peter Parker’s adventure with all the outstanding tech it developed for Miles, including improved lighting and frame rates, ray-traced reflections, lightning-fast load times, and DualSense haptic feedback. And they replaced Peter’s face… which is weird, but at least it showcases the major improvements to facial animations. This is a game that was already worth replaying on PS4, but now that it’s on PS5 it’s a great time to revisit New York and see it at its best."<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-remastered-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></i></strong> -View full IGN review</a>
