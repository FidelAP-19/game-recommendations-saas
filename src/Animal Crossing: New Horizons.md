    <h3><strong>Reviews</strong></h3>

        <strong><i>"Released on the doorstep of a global pandemic, Animal Crossing: New Horizons provided a much need escape to many, selling nearly 34 million copies to date. Routine and discovery play equally important roles as you plan the perfect layout for your island, make friends (or enemies) with all your villagers, and invite your friends to your own little utopia to trade items and swap secrets. It’s brilliant in its simplicity and masterful in the way it encourages players to keep up with chores, redecorate and/or reshape entire plots of land, or burn dozens of hours trying to catch rare fish or find every last seasonal item. It certainly helps that all the writing is supremely funny and that, hundreds of hours in, you’re still able to chuckle at a random comment or find genuine inspiration in the places you’d least expect."<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-games-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></i></strong> -View full IGN review</a>

        <strong><i>"Animal Crossing: New Horizons takes the series and not only drags it back onto home consoles, but improves upon every single facet imaginable. There's more to do, more to see, more to change, more to mould, and more to love; fans and first-time players are going to find themselves losing hours at a time gathering materials, creating new furniture, and making their island undeniably theirs. Every moment is unashamedly blissful, with excellently-written characters that truly feel alive and an island paradise that gives back infinitely more than you put in. Back when Animal Crossing: New Leaf hit the shelves all those years ago and created a whole new generation of fans, many people were wondering how Nintendo could possibly top it, but here we have our answer. This is a masterpiece that it's worth buying a Switch (or two) to play."<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/50-best-nintendo-switch-games-so-far?page=4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></i></strong> -View full Nintendo Life review</a>

        <strong><i>"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the ultimate digital escape. New Horizons builds on the already addicting gameplay of Nintendo's beloved life simulator, allowing you craft your own items and rack up rewarding Nook Miles as you catch bugs, plant trees, interact with your neighbors and find cool clothes and household items for your personal villager. There's always something to work towards in New Horizons, making every moment feel rewarding as you build up the tropical island of your dreams."<a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/round-up/best-nintendo-switch-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></i></strong> -View full Tom's Guide review</a>

        <strong><i>"It’s clear, of course, that Nintendo wants this new update to keep players interested in New Horizons for as long as possible; the days-long time gating is a clear indicator of that. Players who want new content to keep them busy for more hours on end will likely be frustrated, but it works for my new preferred way to play. New Horizons doesn’t feel like a chore anymore, but I think that’s a change in me, rather than in the game itself."<a href="https://www.polygon.com/22783019/animal-crossing-new-horizons-final-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></i></strong> -View full Polygon review</a></i></strong>
