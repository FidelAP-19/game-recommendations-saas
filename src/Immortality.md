        <strong><i>"It would appear that the recent decision by Warner Bros. to scrap the release of its near-completed Batgirl movie was motivated entirely by boring old tax reasons, but what if there was something far more sinister at play? Such is the setup for Immortality, the latest investigative thriller from the makers of Her Story and Telling Lies, which had me scouring through an archive of FMV footage from three unreleased films in an attempt to discover exactly why they never saw the light of day. In spite of some surprisingly shallow search tools what followed was a thoroughly absorbing undertaking that began as a sort of jigsaw puzzle but morphed into the motion picture equivalent of a Magic Eye poster, and I sat completely transfixed as each piece fell into place until suddenly Immortality’s true subject snapped into focus and its shocking bigger picture was revealed."<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/immortality-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></i></strong> -View full IGN review</a>

        <strong><i>"The latest title from Sam Barlow and the Half Mermaid team, Immortality is quite the experience. You're trying to solve the core mystery of what happened to the (fictional) actress Marissa Marcel by tracking her journey through three movies. , clicking on faces, objects, and items to move between clips and discover the narratives that lurk beneath the surface. It's a brilliant tale, which just keeps getting better and better.

        <strong><i>"A game like Immortality could only come from the mindthat created a game like Her Story. This is another full-motion video-style game, but it represents the peak of pushing that genre to the limits. You’re once again scrubbing through real video footage trying to unravel a mystery, but instead of seeing clips and searching keywords like Her Story, this time you swap between scenes by selecting people or objects to find other scenes they appeared in. It doesn’t sound like it should work, but trust us, it does. This is one of the most satisfying stories to unravel, made all the more interesting in how each player will uncover clues at different times, in different orders, and through different paths."<a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/best-xbox-series-x-exclusives/?amp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></i></strong> -View full Digital Trends review</a>
