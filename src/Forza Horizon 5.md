                <h2 class="card__text-m">Forza Horizon 5</h2>
              <p class="card__text-m">Forza Horizon 5 is currently the best racing game out at this moment. The game takes place a fictional Mexico and boasts of a large open map filled with challenges. The games’ ability to customize your car and share car tuning with other player just add to its stunning graphics. The incredible map design which includes volcanos and swamps alongside the variety in cars to pick from is what make it the best racing game out. With the constant update of content being added to the game I don’t see it slowing down in popularity anytime soon.</p>

        <strong><i>"Forza Horizon 5 is, without a doubt, one of the best racing games of all time you can play right now and certainly one of the best looking on the Xbox Series X. Set in a fictional version of Mexico, Forza Horizon 5 boasts the largest open-world map of any of the Forza Horizon games, and there is no shortage of races and challenges to complete. There are also numerous ways to customize your cars by swapping engines, drivetrains, and body kits."<a href="https://gaminggorilla.com/best-xbox-series-x-exclusive-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></i></strong> -View full Gaming Gorilla review</a>

        <strong><i>"The Forza Horizon series is undoubtedly the best racer going at the moment, and this latest entry's jaunt to Mexico continues the hot streak. The South American country hosts plenty of thrilling locations to screech through, from drifting around a volcano to skidding around swamps, with the fleet of cars you race in as eye-meltingly fast as you'd hope for.
